=== netpeek webserver

= Install
netpeek is a suite of web cgi scripts running on a webserver that gives various views into all the data collected by the network suite.
By default all script work is done via sudo, and owned and run as root.
netpeek web cgi scripts reside in the ./netpeek subdirectory of the configured cgi-bin directory of the webserver, commonly found in   /var/www/cgi-bin
In a standard install, copy the unzipped netpeek block into cgi-bin
(If using another directory, adjust command.)

1) default install:  copy unzipped netpeek directory tree to /var/www/cgi-bin using -pr options

sudo cp -pr netpeek  /var/www/cgi-bin

2) Prepare files in /netpeek/lib
Minimal form of the hostname is used, no domain suffix.
Some library files require manual configuration editing.
Edit each of these files in /netwonk/lib :

 - auth.pl - enter userid/netid of authorized users in hash form, by group as needed.

 - dbipw.pl -  password call for database server.  For initial setup and testing, fill in FDQN, user ("network") and password.
When stable edit in local secure password call instead.

 - exroutes.pl - is a primitive way to document external routes included into the output of iproutes.cgi for administrative purposes,
usually only on large complex networks.  Likely not needed.

 - servers.pl - fill in all information as listed, for servers, DNS, IP prefixes, DHCP, NTP, ASA info, admin, list and
user email info, various path info.  EVERYTHING in this file is an example.  Fill in the real network information.
